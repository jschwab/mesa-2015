  ! each star has its own inlists
    inlist_names(1) = 'inlist1'
    inlist_names(2) = 'inlist2'

  ! in this example, we will treat star 2 as a point mass

  ! in inlist1, we will load a saved model for star1

  ! since star2 is a point mass, we need to set its mass (in Msun)
    m2 = 1.4

  ! we need to set the initial orbital properties of the binary
    initial_period_in_days = -1  ! -1 means ignore this

  ! use implicit Roche lobe overflow
    max_tries_to_achieve = 10

  ! transfer efficiency controls
    limit_retention_by_mdot_edd = .false.

  ! turn off magnetic braking in this example
    do_jdot_mb = .false.
